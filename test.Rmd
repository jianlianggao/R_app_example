Getting Started with R
======================

# Introduction

This is an *R Notebook*.

R Notebooks combine text and code into a single document.

Text in a Notebook can be given special formatting using something
called *Markdown*. There is **some basic formatting** in this document,
but it is not important to understand right away - we will take a closer
look later.

Code in an R Notebook is kept in *code chunks* that appear in grey
shaded boxes, like the one below.
